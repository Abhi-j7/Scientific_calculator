Hey Viewer!
This project helps you out to make and improve better calculations at your working area! this GUI application is a basic scientific calculator which helps you to make simple to 
complex calculations fast and easily. The entire project is developed in python where the user performs calculations. This GUI based application is easy to use and understand.
The calculator has got mainly 2 features, that is 1. simple mode and 2. standard mode;
The simple mode enables the user to prform basic calculations where as the Standard mode enables the user to make complex calculations which include trigonometric ratios and their 
values. These also include complex functions which helps the user to make calculations easier.
This GUI based application's font size and colour context can be changed further as required by the used.

The project focuses on reducing the time complexity of making calculations either of simple type or of complex numbers, by providing the user with a better GUI based application,
the problems of calculating the simple to complex calculations are ruled-out and do refer the code and its ouput screen.
